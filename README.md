# Your first scraper

- Repository: `Wikipedia Scrapper`
- Type of Challenge: `Learning`
- Duration: `3 days`
- Submission: `23/06/2023 4:30 PM`

- Team challenge : `Solo`

## The Mission

In this project, we will guide you step by step through the process of:

1. creating a self-contained development environment.
1. retrieving some information from an API (a website for computers)
2. leveraging it to scrape a website that does not provide an API
3. saving the output for later processing

Here we query an API for a list of countries and their past leaders. We then extract and sanitize their short bio from Wikipedia. Finally, we save the data to disk.

This task is often the first (coding) step of a datascience project and you will often come back to it in the future.

## Learning objectives

You will study topics such as *scraping*, *data structures*, *regular expressions*, *concurrency* and *file handling*. We will point out useful resources at the appropriate time.
